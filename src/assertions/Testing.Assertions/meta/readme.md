Testing.Assertions
===

The assertions library which contains all of the provided assertion extension
methods to use along with a test framework adapter package.

This package is optional and you can always replace it with your own custom assertions.

On it's own this package isn't very useful, make sure to use it along with a test
framework adapter package like `OwlDomain.Testing.MSTest`.
