Testing.Base
===

The base library for the 
[OwlDomain.Testing](https://github.com/Owl-Domain/Testing)
framework, this package only provides the `IAssert` interface,
and the `FormattingHelper` static class.

You should only directly reference this package when you are
either creating custom assertions, or creating a custom
test framework adapter.
